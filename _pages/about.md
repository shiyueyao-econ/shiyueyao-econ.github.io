Shiyue Yao is a PhD candidate in Environmental Economics at NC State University. Before entering the PhD program, she studied Energy Economics at Beihang University in Beijing, China. Shiyue's current research interests span environmental and resource economics, climate economics, and applied econometrics, focusing particularly on developing models to assess the effectiveness of environmental policies and their role in facilitating climate change mitigation and adaptation.

During her doctoral studies, Shiyue has applied advanced econometric techniques, such as the Synthetic Control Method and Difference-in-Differences, to explore the effects of renewable energy policies on bio-energy use. She has also utilized Stochastic Dynamic Programming to study the adoption decisions for Agrivoltaics in California's Central Valley. This research underscores the economic viability and environmental benefits of integrating agriculture with photovoltaic systems and examines their broader impacts on climate and groundwater sustainability.

Her research is complemented by substantial industry experience, including advanced internships at Amazon where she led significant causal inference projects. These roles allowed her to apply her analytical skills to real-world business challenges, enhancing decision-making processes and contributing to sustainability initiatives.

Shiyue is committed to advancing research on dynamic decision-making processes in environmental economics, focusing on developing and implementing policies that effectively balance economic growth with environmental preservation. Her dedication to academic excellence and meaningful research is evident in her roles as a Graduate Student Library Representative and Graduate Peer Mentor at NC State, where she actively supports and contributes to the academic community.
